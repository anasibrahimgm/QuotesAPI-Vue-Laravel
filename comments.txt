when we send the body from postman with duplicated email
z.B.
  {
  "name": "anas",
  "email": "anas@b.c",
  "password": "123456"
  }
to get the real error that
      {"email":["The email has already been taken."]}
 we have to add Headers:
  Content-Type: application/json
  X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest

  we simply pass the provided token we get when signin
  as a parameter to postman when we want to create a new Quote

  the middleware has its own messages and it overwrites our Handler.php messages
